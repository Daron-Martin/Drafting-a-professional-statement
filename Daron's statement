   I am transitioning from the Service Desk L2 environment to the Cybersecurity sphere.
Due to the passion I have for Infosec I consistently lab daily using SIEM tools. I also listen to
cybersec podcasts such as ‘Darknet diaries’ when I am not studying for a certification. The last
certification I recently received was Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate.
My unique combination of education, skills and work experience has allowed me to develop
great incident response/management, technical aptitude, analytical mindset and 5-star soft skills.
Because of my varied background, I am a resourceful and creative problem solver. I can always
find multiple solutions to even the most complex problems
